# TODO

- [ ] Dispatchers and sessions columns take more horizontal space than the text requires - looks like unnecessary padding
- [ ] When sessions show the loading indicator, show a timer for how long they have been running
- [ ] Settings section to specify which XMPP server to connect to
- [ ] Clicking on a dispatcher should open its chat view instead of showing a blank screen
- [ ] Debug desktop notifications - they are implemented (NotificationService.swift) but not working at all
- [ ] Auto-focus textarea when selecting a dispatcher or session so the user can start typing immediately
- [ ] Don't force scroll to bottom when new messages arrive while user is reading earlier content - show a "scroll to bottom" indicator instead (like Telegram does)
